## Audio

Sonos driven. Everything is wireless and driven by your phones.

* TV sound bar (newer $400 version) not released yet
* [Play 5](https://amzn.to/2taSabz) ($499)
* Record player ($529)

This gives you internet radio, spotify, [tidal](https://www.sonos.com/en-us/tidal-on-sonos), amazon music.

### Record Player

Open questions:

* Do you want Alexa integration with your sound bar? 

### Outdoor Audio

You can either go with a Connect AMP ($500) and then wire up some really good outdoor speakers ($150) and have them integrated with your sonos system.

OR

Get a [Sonos One](https://amzn.to/2t8yzsj) ($149) or [Alexa integrated](https://amzn.to/2JDxRP9) ($199) and keep it in your bedroom, when you're not using it, bring it outside. It's not as convenient, but it sounds pretty damn good and it's an easy, cheaper, solution.

## Television

Best TVs can be found on wirecutter here. I like my TCL Roku all in one TV, and they're top recommended. [55" TV](https://amzn.to/2HNgSUL) costs $650 currently. [The 65"](https://wclink.co/link/26194/140973/4/74311/1772988440.1518044855?merchant=Walmart) (which is probably too big) costs $1000 from walmart.

I'm thinking that a rolling concept might work best, so have a simple media console that has wheels, and move it around in front of the window when you want to use it. As long as there is only one cable that moves along with the cart, then we could keep things nice and clean as well. Securing things will also be important, because people like to do dumb stuff when they're renting. Perhaps screwing down the TV.

We can get a sturdy wheeled media console, and a custom TV mount that secures down into the media console, and can be raised and swiveled. 

Examples of media console:

### Streaming

Sign up for services uses Roku. Apple TV would work fine, Fire TV would probably too. 

### Antenna over the air Cable

The closest TV Towers to Cave B are in Yakima, then the Tri-Cities. Each are about 50 miles away. Each signal could be low, but you might be able to get reception from NBC, CBS, ABC, Fox, PBS. We should try to get a 50 mile antenna and see if we can pick up some stations.

Purchase:
30 bucks on amazon: https://amzn.to/2ybNd80

Let's try this out and if that doesn't work, we can figure out which streaming services will get you the appropriate sports.

## Internet / WiFi

So you will have access to Fiber, you'll get a modem from CenturyLink or whatever provider is over there.

Best Wireless Router: [Netgear AC2300](https://amzn.to/2sYaPI4)

We can keep both the router and the modem provided by CenturyLink in the Mech. cabinet, because the range needed is so small. Open question: Will AirBnB people have access to the mech. cabinet? They'll probably need to restart the modem from time to time. 

We will need to set up a wireless network with a password easily accessible by guests. 

## Security

Do you want a smart doorbell so that you can reprogram your key codes for each unique visitor? Keep track of indoor / outdoor comings and goings?
Do you want cameras installed inside or outside?

## Other considerations

* Cable organization
* Surge protectors
* Smaller audio cables (Audio in to Sonos Play 5)
* Smaller video cables (HDMI from TV to sonos)
* Can upgrade and get a subwoofer from Sonos (probably not necessary for $699)
