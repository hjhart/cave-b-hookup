## Television

Best TVs can be found on wirecutter here. I like my TCL Roku all in one TV, and they're top recommended. [55" TV](https://amzn.to/2HNgSUL) costs $650 currently. [The 65"](https://wclink.co/link/26194/140973/4/74311/1772988440.1518044855?merchant=Walmart) (which may be a bit too big) costs $1000 from walmart.

I'm thinking that a rolling concept might work best, so have a simple media console that has wheels, and move it around in front of the window when you want to use it. As long as there is only one cable that moves along with the cart, then we could keep things nice and clean as well. Securing things will also be important, because people like to do dumb stuff when they're renting. Perhaps screwing down the TV.

We can get a sturdy wheeled media console, and a custom TV mount that secures down into the media console, and can be raised and swiveled. 

Examples of media console:

### Streaming

Sign up for services uses Roku. Apple TV would work fine, Fire TV would probably too. 

### Antenna over the air Cable

The closest TV Towers to Cave B are in Yakima, then the Tri-Cities. Each are about 50 miles away. Each signal could be low, but you might be able to get reception from NBC, CBS, ABC, Fox, PBS. We should try to get a 50 mile antenna and see if we can pick up some stations.
